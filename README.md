# mock-data
To provide an appropriate description for the dataset, I'll first need to examine its contents. I'll load and display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure and the type of data it contains. Let's proceed with that.

The dataset appears to be related to loans and contains the following columns:

loan_id: A unique identifier for each loan.
applicant_name: The name of the loan applicant.
loan_amount: The amount of the loan.
interest_rate: The interest rate applied to the loan.
loan_duration_months: The duration of the loan in months.
property_value: The value of the property associated with the loan.
property_type: The type of property (e.g., Condo, Apartment, Townhouse).
credit_score: The credit score of the applicant.
employment_status: The employment status of the applicant.
approval_status: Whether the loan was approved or not.
Description for the Dataset
This dataset contains information about loan applications, including details about the applicants, loan terms, and property associated with the loans. The dataset can be used for various analyses such as:

Assessing loan approval rates based on different criteria (e.g., credit score, employment status).
Analyzing the distribution of loan amounts and interest rates.
Evaluating the impact of property type and value on loan approvals.
Studying the relationship between loan duration and approval status.
This dataset is valuable for financial institutions, researchers, and data analysts interested in understanding loan approval processes and factors influencing loan decisions.
